# NeuraScale Neural Engine

The Neural Engine is the core processing system for NeuraScale, handling real-time brain signal processing, machine learning inference, and virtual avatar control.

## Overview

This engine processes petabytes of brain data from Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), performs real-time signal processing, and enables control of virtual avatars through NVIDIA Omniverse integration.
