# Overview

The system modeling documentation uses industry-standard diagram types to represent the internal workings of NeuraScale. These diagrams provide detailed insights into how components interact, data flows through the system, and state transitions occur during operations.

## Diagram Types

### Flowcharts
Step-by-step process flows for key operations including:
- Device connection and initialization
- Session management lifecycle
- Real-time data streaming flow

### Sequence Diagrams
Time-ordered interactions between system components showing:
- Device streaming sequences
- Authentication flows
- Clinical workflow processes
- GraphQL API request handling

### State Diagrams
State transitions for critical system components:
- Device state machine
- Processing pipeline states
- System error recovery mechanisms

### Entity Relationship Diagrams
Data model relationships and schemas including:
- Core data model structure
- Service relationships
- Database schemas

### Component Interaction Diagrams
Detailed service communication patterns showing:
- Synchronous and asynchronous interactions
- Message passing between services
- Infrastructure dependencies

## Navigation Guide

Each diagram type has its own dedicated section with:
- High-resolution diagrams using Mermaid
- Detailed explanations of each component
- Implementation notes and best practices
- Performance considerations

## Color Coding

All diagrams use the Google color scheme for consistency:
- Blue (#4285F4) - Primary components and data sources
- Green (#34A853) - Successful states and operations
- Yellow (#FBBC04) - Processing and intermediate states
- Red (#EA4335) - Error states and critical paths
