## Version Guidelines

### Version Format
We use Semantic Versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR**: Backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH**: Backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Release Process

1. **Development Phase**
   - Features developed in feature branches
   - Merged to `develop` branch after review
   - Automated testing in CI/CD pipeline

2. **Release Candidate**
   - Create release branch from `develop`
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Conduct integration testing
   - Fix any critical issues

3. **Production Release**
   - Merge release branch to `main`
   - Tag with version number
   - Deploy to production
   - Update documentation

4. **Post-Release**
   - Monitor metrics and logs
   - Address any hotfixes needed
   - Merge fixes back to `develop`

### Breaking Changes Policy

<Callout type="warning">
Breaking changes are only introduced in major version releases and are announced at least 30 days in advance.
</Callout>

When introducing breaking changes:

1. Deprecation warnings added in MINOR release
2. Migration guide published
3. Support for old version maintained for 6 months
4. Clear communication to all users

## Migration Guides

### Migrating from 1.x to 2.0

#### API Changes

```python
# Old API (1.x)
from neurascale import ProcessingClient
client = ProcessingClient(api_key="...")
result = client.process_eeg(data)

# New API (2.0)
from neurascale import NeuralEngine
engine = NeuralEngine(api_key="...")
result = await engine.process_signal(
    data=data,
    signal_type="EEG",
    device_type="OpenBCI"
)
```

#### Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- Migration script for 1.x to 2.0
ALTER TABLE sessions
ADD COLUMN device_type VARCHAR(50),
ADD COLUMN signal_quality FLOAT,
ADD COLUMN metadata JSONB;

-- Update existing records
UPDATE sessions
SET device_type = 'Unknown',
    signal_quality = 1.0,
    metadata = '{}'::jsonb
WHERE device_type IS NULL;
```

#### Configuration Changes

```yaml
# Old configuration (1.x)
neurascale:
  api_endpoint: https://api.neurascale.com/v1
  processing_mode: batch

# New configuration (2.0)
neurascale:
  api_endpoint: https://api.neurascale.com/v2
  processing_mode: stream
  device_config:
    type: OpenBCI
    channels: 16
    sampling_rate: 250
```
