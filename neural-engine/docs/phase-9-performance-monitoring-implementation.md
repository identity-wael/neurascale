# Phase 9: Performance Monitoring Implementation

## Overview

Phase 9 implements comprehensive performance monitoring for the Neural Engine, providing real-time insights into system health, resource usage, and processing performance with minimal overhead (<2% CPU).

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **PerformanceMonitor** (`performance_monitor.py`)

   - Main orchestrator for all monitoring activities
   - Coordinates metric collection, alerting, and health checks
   - Manages monitoring lifecycle and report generation

2. **Metrics Collectors**

   - **NeuralMetricsCollector**: Tracks signal processing latency, feature extraction time, model inference latency, data quality scores
   - **DeviceMetricsCollector**: Monitors device connection stability, data rates, signal quality, error rates
   - **SystemMetricsCollector**: Collects CPU, memory, disk, and network usage statistics

3. **Exporters & Integrations**

   - **PrometheusCollector**: Exports metrics in Prometheus format for time-series storage
   - **NeuralTracer**: OpenTelemetry integration for distributed tracing
   - **GrafanaDashboardManager**: Automated dashboard creation and management

4. **Health & Alerting**
   - **HealthChecker**: Component-level health monitoring with configurable thresholds
   - **AlertManager**: Multi-channel alert routing with severity levels and silence rules

## Key Features

### Real-time Metrics Collection

- Neural processing metrics: latency, throughput, accuracy
- Device performance: connection stability, data rates, packet loss
- System resources: CPU, memory, disk, network usage
- Configurable collection intervals (100ms for neural, 1s for devices, 5s for system)

### Distributed Tracing

- Full request flow tracking with OpenTelemetry
- Span creation for each processing stage
- Context propagation across service boundaries
- Jaeger integration for visualization

### Alert Management

- Rule-based alerting with configurable thresholds
- Severity levels: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO
- Multi-channel notifications: Slack, PagerDuty, email
- Alert silencing and deduplication

### Dashboard Automation

- Pre-configured Grafana dashboards:
  - Neural Processing Performance
  - Device Monitoring
  - System Performance
  - Alert Management
- Automatic panel creation with proper queries and thresholds

## Usage Example

```python
from neural_engine.src.monitoring import (
    PerformanceMonitor,
    MonitoringConfig,
    AlertRule,
    AlertSeverity,
)

# Configure monitoring
config = MonitoringConfig(
    neural_metrics_interval_ms=100,
    device_metrics_interval_ms=1000,
    system_metrics_interval_ms=5000,
    prometheus_port=9090,
    grafana_url="http://localhost:3000",
)

# Create and start monitor
monitor = PerformanceMonitor(config)
await monitor.start_monitoring()

# Register custom alerts
monitor.alert_manager.register_alert_rule(
    AlertRule(
        name="HighLatency",
        expression="signal_processing_latency > 100",
        duration=timedelta(minutes=2),
        severity=AlertSeverity.CRITICAL,
    )
)

# Collect metrics
neural_metrics = await monitor.collect_neural_metrics("session_001")
device_metrics = await monitor.monitor_device_performance("device_001")

# Generate report
report = monitor.generate_performance_report(start_time, end_time)
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **CPU Overhead**: <2% as validated by performance tests
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB baseline for monitoring components
- **Metric Collection Latency**: <0.1ms per metric
- **Alert Processing**: <10ms from detection to notification

## Integration Points

1. **Neural Processing Pipeline**: Automatic instrumentation of processing stages
2. **Device Interface**: Metrics collection integrated with device communication
3. **API Layer**: Request/response tracking and latency measurement
4. **Database**: Query performance monitoring

## Configuration

Key configuration parameters in `MonitoringConfig`:

- `max_processing_latency_ms`: Alert threshold for processing latency
- `min_data_quality_score`: Minimum acceptable data quality
- `max_device_error_rate`: Maximum tolerable error rate
- `enable_distributed_tracing`: Toggle for OpenTelemetry
- `alert_channels`: List of notification channels to enable

## Files Created

- `src/monitoring/performance_monitor.py`: Main orchestrator
- `src/monitoring/metrics/`: Metric collectors (neural, device, system)
- `src/monitoring/collectors/`: Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, health checker
- `src/monitoring/alerting/`: Alert management system
- `src/monitoring/dashboards/`: Grafana dashboard automation
- `tests/performance/monitoring/`: Performance validation tests
- `examples/monitoring_usage.py`: Complete usage example

## Next Steps

With Phase 9 complete, the Neural Engine now has comprehensive observability. Future enhancements could include:

- Machine learning-based anomaly detection
- Predictive alerting based on trend analysis
- Custom metric aggregations
- Integration with cloud monitoring services
