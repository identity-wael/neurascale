# GitHub Actions Runner Setup Summary

## Configuration Complete âœ…

Successfully set up **6 parallel GitHub Actions runners** to maximize CI/CD throughput with your 24GB RAM and 12 CPU setup.

### Runners Online:

- `neurascale-local` (original)
- `neurascale-local-2`
- `neurascale-local-3`
- `neurascale-local-4`
- `neurascale-local-5`
- `neurascale-local-6`

### Current Status:

- All 6 runners are **online** and connected to GitHub
- Build jobs are running in parallel across multiple runners
- Each runner can handle 1 job at a time
- System is efficiently utilizing available resources

### Resource Usage:

- Each active runner uses approximately 2-4GB RAM during builds
- Peak usage with all 6 runners: ~18GB RAM, leaving headroom for system
- Docker builds are distributed across runners for parallel execution

### Management Scripts Created:

1. **`quick-runner-config.sh`** - Configure runners with automatic token retrieval
2. **`start-configured-runners.sh`** - Start already configured runners
3. **`monitor-pipeline.sh`** - Monitor pipeline and runner status

### Quick Commands:

```bash
# Monitor all runners
gh api repos/identity-wael/neurascale/actions/runners --jq '.runners[] | {name: .name, status: .status, busy: .busy}'

# Watch pipeline progress
watch -n 5 ./monitor-pipeline.sh

# View runner logs
tail -f /Users/weg/actions-runner-*/runner.log

# Stop all runners
pkill -f 'Runner.Listener'

# Start all configured runners
./start-configured-runners.sh
```

### Pipeline Performance:

- Build jobs now run in parallel (api, ingestion, processor)
- Significantly reduced total pipeline execution time
- Better resource utilization with distributed workload

The Neural Engine CI/CD pipeline is now optimized for maximum throughput!
