Match the menu height, the spacing of text inside of the search, the curvature of the search box, the place where the text is placed same spacing, the color shape and dimensions of the search bar. The rest looks okay but your profile is a bit bigger make it smaller. Use the MCP Browser to compare both pages and verify your changes."
