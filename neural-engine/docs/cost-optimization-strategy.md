# Cost Optimization Strategy for Neural Engine

## Overview

This document outlines the cost optimization strategies implemented for the Neural Engine infrastructure across development, staging, and production environments.

## 1. Bigtable Optimization

### Production Environment

- **Autoscaling Enabled**: Bigtable automatically scales between 2-10 nodes based on CPU utilization (target: 60%)
- **SSD Storage**: 1TB allocated for production workloads
- **Cost Impact**: ~$2,000-$7,000/month depending on load

### Non-Production Environments

- **Scheduled Scaling**:
  - Scale up to 2 nodes during business hours (8 AM - 7 PM EST weekdays)
  - Scale down to 1 node during off-hours and weekends
- **Cost Savings**: ~40% reduction in compute costs for dev/staging
- **Implementation**: Cloud Scheduler jobs trigger scaling events

## 2. Cloud Functions Optimization

### Resource Limits

- Memory: 512MB for ingestion functions (optimized from initial 1GB)
- Timeout: 60s for stream processing
- Concurrency: Limited to prevent runaway costs

### Cold Start Mitigation

- Minimum instances: 0 (to minimize idle costs)
- Use warmup requests for critical functions in production

## 3. Storage Optimization

### Bigtable Data Retention

- Development: 7 days
- Staging: 30 days
- Production: 90 days (configurable based on compliance needs)

### Archive Strategy

- Export old data to Cloud Storage (Nearline) after retention period
- Use lifecycle policies to transition to Coldline after 180 days

## 4. Monitoring and Alerting

### Budget Alerts

- 50% threshold: Information alert
- 75% threshold: Warning to team lead
- 90% threshold: Critical alert to finance
- 100% threshold: Immediate action required

### Cost Dashboards

- Real-time spend tracking by service
- Resource utilization metrics
- Anomaly detection for unusual spikes

## 5. Development Best Practices

### Resource Cleanup

- Automated cleanup of test resources after 24 hours
- Terraform destroy for feature branches
- Regular audit of unused resources

### Efficient Testing

- Use Cloud Build for CI/CD (included free tier)
- Share test datasets across environments
- Use preemptible VMs for batch processing

## 6. Cost Allocation

### Tagging Strategy

All resources are tagged with:

- `environment`: development/staging/production
- `team`: neural-engineering
- `cost_center`: Specific cost center for chargeback
- `project_phase`: phase-2
- `service`: neural-data-platform

### Billing Export

- BigQuery export enabled for detailed analysis
- 90-day retention for billing data
- Monthly reports generated automatically

## 7. Estimated Monthly Costs

### Development Environment

- Bigtable: ~$300 (with scheduled scaling)
- Cloud Functions: ~$50
- Storage: ~$100
- **Total**: ~$450/month

### Staging Environment

- Bigtable: ~$500 (with scheduled scaling)
- Cloud Functions: ~$200
- Storage: ~$300
- **Total**: ~$1,000/month

### Production Environment

- Bigtable: ~$2,000-$7,000 (with autoscaling)
- Cloud Functions: ~$1,000
- Storage: ~$1,500
- **Total**: ~$4,500-$9,500/month

## 8. Cost Optimization Roadmap

### Q1 2024

- ✅ Implement scheduled scaling for non-production
- ✅ Enable Bigtable autoscaling for production
- ✅ Set up budget alerts

### Q2 2024

- [ ] Implement data archival pipeline
- [ ] Optimize Cloud Functions memory allocation
- [ ] Evaluate Spot VMs for batch processing

### Q3 2024

- [ ] Implement FinOps dashboard
- [ ] Cross-region cost optimization
- [ ] Reserved capacity planning

## 9. Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check current Bigtable node count
gcloud bigtable clusters list --instance=neural-data-[environment]

# View current month's costs
gcloud billing accounts get-iam-policy [BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]

# Check budget status
gcloud billing budgets list --billing-account=[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]
```

## 10. Emergency Cost Control

If costs exceed budget:

1. Immediately scale down Bigtable to minimum nodes
2. Disable non-critical Cloud Functions
3. Pause data ingestion if necessary
4. Alert stakeholders via PagerDuty
