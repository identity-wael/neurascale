# Neural Engine Specifications

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for Neural Engine components. These specifications serve as the authoritative source for implementation requirements, API contracts, and architectural decisions.

## Specification Documents

### 1. [Neural Ledger Specification](./neural-ledger-specification.md)

- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Status**: Ready for Implementation
- **Priority**: CRITICAL (P0)
- **Description**: Immutable audit trail system for HIPAA compliance and data integrity

## Document Structure

Each specification follows this structure:

1. Executive Summary
2. System Context
3. Functional Requirements
4. Technical Architecture
5. Implementation Details
6. Performance Requirements
7. Security Considerations
8. Monitoring and Alerting
9. Testing Requirements
10. Migration and Rollout Plan
11. Cost Estimation
12. Success Criteria

## Specification Status

- **Draft**: Under development, not ready for implementation
- **Review**: Complete draft, under technical review
- **Ready for Implementation**: Approved and ready for development
- **Implemented**: Development complete, specification is now documentation
- **Deprecated**: No longer valid, kept for historical reference

## Process

1. **Creation**: Principal/Senior Engineers create specifications
2. **Review**: Team reviews via pull request
3. **Approval**: Tech lead approves for implementation
4. **Implementation**: Backend engineers implement per specification
5. **Validation**: QA validates against specification
6. **Documentation**: Specification becomes system documentation

## Upcoming Specifications

Based on the refined task list, the following specifications are planned:

1. **Device Interface Enhancement Specification** (Task 1.1-1.2)
2. **Advanced Signal Processing Specification** (Task 5.1-5.2)
3. **FastAPI Migration Specification** (Task 6.1)
4. **Access Control Implementation Specification** (Task 3.2)
5. **Monitoring Infrastructure Specification** (Task 4.1-4.4)

## Contributing

When creating a new specification:

1. Use the neural-ledger-specification.md as a template
2. Include realistic GCP service usage and costs
3. Define clear success criteria
4. Provide code examples for critical components
5. Include integration points with existing systems
