- **Throughput**: 1.2GB/s sustained data processing

### Machine Learning Infrastructure

- **Movement decoder**: Real-time BCI control for cursor/avatar movement
- **Emotion classifier**: Valence-arousal detection from neural signals
- **Model serving**: WebSocket-based inference with <20ms latency
- **Training pipeline**: Automated with Vertex AI and experiment tracking

### Production-Ready Infrastructure
