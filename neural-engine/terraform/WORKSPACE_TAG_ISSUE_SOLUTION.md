# Terraform Cloud Workspace Tag Issue - Analysis and Solution

## Problem Summary

The error "Only one of workspace 'tags' or 'name' is allowed" occurs because:

1. The Terraform configuration in `main.tf` uses the `tags` strategy:

   ```hcl
   cloud {
     hostname     = "app.terraform.io"
     organization = "neurascale"

     workspaces {
       tags = ["neural-engine"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. But when running Terraform, the `TF_WORKSPACE` environment variable is being set to a specific workspace name (e.g., `neural-engine-staging`)

3. These two approaches are mutually exclusive in Terraform Cloud

## Current State

- **Workspaces exist**: neural-engine-development, neural-engine-staging, neural-engine-production
- **Tags on workspaces**: None (the workspaces don't have any tags)
- **Configuration expects**: Workspaces with tag "neural-engine"
- **Execution uses**: Specific workspace name via TF_WORKSPACE

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Use Workspace Names (Recommended for this setup)

Since you already have specific workspaces created and are using environment variables to select them, modify the Terraform configuration to use the `name` strategy:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"

  cloud {
    hostname     = "app.terraform.io"
    organization = "neurascale"

    workspaces {
      name = "neural-engine-${terraform.workspace}"
    }
  }

  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

However, this approach doesn't work well with the TF_WORKSPACE variable. Instead, use:

### Option 2: Remove Cloud Block Workspace Configuration

Let Terraform use the TF_WORKSPACE environment variable directly:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.5.0"

  cloud {
    hostname     = "app.terraform.io"
    organization = "neurascale"
    # Remove the workspaces block entirely
  }

  # ... rest of configuration
}
```

Then continue using:

```bash
export TF_WORKSPACE=neural-engine-development
terraform init
terraform plan
```

### Option 3: Use Tags Strategy (Requires Tag Addition)

If you prefer to use tags:

1. First, add tags to workspaces (this requires using the Terraform Cloud UI or a working API call)
2. Remove the TF_WORKSPACE environment variable
3. Use terraform workspace selection:

```bash
# Don't set TF_WORKSPACE
unset TF_WORKSPACE

# Initialize (Terraform will list available workspaces with matching tags)
terraform init

# Select a workspace
terraform workspace select neural-engine-development

# Or use -workspace flag
terraform plan -workspace=neural-engine-development
```

## Immediate Fix

For immediate resolution, implement Option 2 by removing the workspaces block from main.tf:

```bash
# Edit main.tf and remove lines 8-10 (the workspaces block)
# Keep the cloud block but remove the nested workspaces configuration
```

This will allow the existing workflow using TF_WORKSPACE to continue working.
